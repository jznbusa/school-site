				<p> When the ownership of the Mapúa University (previously known as the Mapúa Institute of Technology) was transferred 
				to the Yuchengco Group of Companies (YGC) under the stewardship of the honorable Ambassador Alfonso T. Yuchengco in 
				the year 1999, a great amount of effort was put into improving the academic programs and facilities of the institution, 
				thus raising Mapúa’s level to be at par with international standards.

			<h1>The history of <span style="color: #f44336">Mapúa</span> Malayan Colleges Laguna</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="history-col reveal fade-bottom">
			<img src="images/einsteinbldg.jpg">
			<p>Through the years, new programs such as Computer Science, Information Technology, Material Science and Engineering, Biotechnology, 
			Nursing, Psychology, Accountancy, and Hotel and Restaurant Management have been added to Mapúa’s offering of Engineering and Architecture programs.
			<br><br>The expansion did not stop there, however. In fulfillment of the long-term development plan of Mapúa, a six-hectare land was acquired for its 
			expansion and presence in Laguna, which stands as one of CALABARZON’s industrial and commercial hubs.   			
			<br><br>Groundwork started in late 2005, and on January 23, 2006, Malayan Colleges Laguna (MCL) acquired its corporate personality following its registration 
			with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
			<br><br>This paved the way for the creation of an interim group geared to ensure the ultimate achievement of MCL’s vision and mission statements. Under the 
			leadership of Dr. Reynaldo B. Vea, Mapúa President and CEO, and formerly the MCL President and CEO, were the following members from Mapúa, namely: Milagros 
			V. Reyes, former Mapúa Executive Vice President for Administration and Chief Operating Officer; Engr. Dodjie S. Maestrecampo, then Executive Vice President 
			for Academic Affairs; Engr. Dennis H. Tablante, Dean of the School of EE-ECECoE; Engr. Christopher F. dela Rosa, Director of Mapúa’s Development Office for 
			Information Technology; and Raoul A. Villegas, Controller of the Mapúa IT Center.  
			<br><br>In November 2006, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) gave the approval for MCL to offer eight (8) programs of study in Engineering, Information 
			Technology, and Business. This was after MCL’s satisfactory compliance with the standards of the CHED’s Regional Quality Assurance Team. 
			<br><br>MCL started with over 860 freshmen students during its first year of operations. Its first two buildings were named after two significant personalities: 
			Dr. Jose P. Rizal and Enrique T. Yuchengco.  
			<br><br>Three (3) colleges were initially established under MCL: the Mapúa Institute of Technology at Laguna (MITL), the E.T. Yuchengco College of Business (ETYCB), 
			and the College of Information Technology, which was later renamed as the College of Computer and Information Science (CCIS). The College of Arts and Science (CAS) 
			and the Mapúa-PTC College of Maritime Education and Training (Mapúa-PTC CMET) were eventually added, followed by the Institute for Excellence in Continuing Education 
			and Lifelong Learning (I-ExCELL).  
			<br><br>In 2016, MCL Senior High School was established as MCL’s response to the implementation of K-12 in basic education. To shelter the institution’s growing community, 
			the Albert Einstein Building was constructed, named after the scientist who, in his lifetime’s work, exuded MCL’s motto: Excellence and Virtue.  
			<br><br>By 2023, the institution has achieved several more milestones with its partnerships with Arizona State University for its business and health sciences programs, 
			and the Business College of Athens for its master’s degree programs in the field of maritime education; as well as with the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
			of the rebrand of Malayan Colleges Laguna to Mapúa Malayan Colleges Laguna. This new name allows Mapúa MCL to fully embrace its roots and Mapúa heritage and gives students 
			the opportunity to start their respective career paths immediately after graduation.  
			<br><br>Today, Mapúa MCL offers four (4) Senior High School strands under the Academic and Technical-Vocational-Livelihood Tracks; over twenty college programs catering 
			to the fields of engineering, architecture, business, health sciences, information technology, multimedia arts, and maritime education; two (2) fully online degree programs; 
			several certification programs under the Institute for Continuing Education and Lifelong Learning (I-ExCELL); and master’s degree programs.
